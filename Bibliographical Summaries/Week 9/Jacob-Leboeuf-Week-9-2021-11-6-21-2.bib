Abstract = {A novel method is presented to evaluate on the graphics processing unit (GPU) the force and torque on a spacecraft due to solar radiation pressure. The method employs efficient ray tracing techniques, developed in the graphics rendering discipline, to resolve spacecraft self-shadowing and reflections at faster than real-time computation speed. The primary algorithmic components of the ray tracing process which contribute to the method’s computational efficiency are described. These components include two-level bounding volume hierarchy acceleration data structures, fast ray to bounding box intersection testing using the slab intersection algorithm and fast triangle intersection testing using the Möller-Trumbore algorithm. Spacecraft material optical properties are represented as a combination of Lambertian diffuse and ideal specular reflections. Both diffuse and specular ray-surface interactions are modeled. The approach is implemented using C++ and OpenCL and executed on a consumer g},

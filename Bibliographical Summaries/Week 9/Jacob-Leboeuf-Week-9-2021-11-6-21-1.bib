Abstract = {GRAY (High Energy Photon Ray Tracer) is a Monte-Carlo ray-driven high energy photon transport engine for PET and SPECT applications that supports complex mesh based primitives for source distributions, phantom shapes, and detector geometries. Ray tracing is a technique used in computer graphics to render scenes with realistic light properties. We adapted this technique to accelerate solving the intersection test problems in our simulator. Monte Carlo simulations study the performance of PET systems, test signal processing algorithms, guide the design of advanced PET systems, data correction schemes, and image reconstruction algorithms. GPU acceleration of these simulations makes these studies more practical while avoiding the need of a large, expensive computer cluster. Recent improvements in the computing power and programmability of graphics processing units (GPUs) have enabled the possibility of using GPUs for the acceleration of scientific applications, including time-consuming si},

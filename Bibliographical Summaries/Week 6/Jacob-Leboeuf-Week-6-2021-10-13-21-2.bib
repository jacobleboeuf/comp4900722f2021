One key aspect of volumetric rendering is the ability to provide perceptual cues to aid in understanding structure contained in the data. While shading models that reproduce natural lighting conditions have been shown to better convey depth information and spatial relationships, they traditionally require considerable (pre)computation. In this paper, a shading model for interactive direct volume rendering is proposed that provides perceptual cues similar to those of ambient occlusion, for both },

Abstract = {An understanding of human embryology is essential for students to better understand the subjects of human anatomy and physiology. However, human embryology is a challenging subject for many, since they must learn how anatomic structures and physiological processes develop over a period of time. Embryology texts typically use static, two-dimensional images to illustrate the dynamic three-dimensional developmental processes, making it difficult for a student to understand spatial relationships and sequential steps. To help students conceptualize these series of complex dynamic developmental events that occur over time, two of the authors and a graphic artist developed six web-based cardiovascular embryology animations and housed them on an Indiana University website. This research study examines knowledge gains and user satisfaction of students, faculty, and laypeople around the world who accessed these six website animations. Data collection spanned 6 yr, and pretest/posttest assessmen},

Abstract = {Mobile devices differ from desktop computers in that they have a limited power source, a battery, and they tend to spend more CPU time on the graphical user interface (GUI). These two facts force us to consider different software approaches in the mobile device kernel that can conserve battery life and reduce latency, which is the duration of time between the inception of an event and the reaction to the event. One area to consider is a software package called the display server. The display server is middleware that handles all GUI activities between an application and the operating system, such as event handling and drawing to the screen. In both desktop and mobile devices, the display server is located in the application layer. However, the kernel layer contains most of the information needed for handling events and drawing graphics, which forces the application-level display server to make a series of system calls in order to coordinate events and to draw graphics. These calls int},
